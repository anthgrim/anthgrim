### Hello Yellow! (because "Hello World!" is overused) 👋

I'm currently learning the MERN Stack with the MIT/xPro - Full Stack Development course. I'm passionate about programming, and sciences in general (with a special focus in Mathematics and the way the Universe is designed 🛰️🔭). I believe the future is written in binary 🤖, and that new coding techonologies will open a lot of opportunities to the world.
